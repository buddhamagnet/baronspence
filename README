This is a collection of clues in code. Each program relates (by numerical sequence) to a series
of sequences released across other virtual and physial media. Git is used to version control these
sequences and they have been placed on github in case readers and fans want to scrutinise or even 
better, fork, these items to unpeel the universe of Baron Spence.

A .gitgnore file has been created to exclude the .true files that contain the true meaning of
each sequence. The .true files themselves will be uploaded to a hidden location that can be
ascertained from following the media trail.
